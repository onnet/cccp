Calling Card Callback Platform

Could be good for road warriors:

- give a call to the customer as if you are calling from your office i.e. hide behind your companie's CID
  (Unlike to cf_disa, no disa callflows should be created at customer's accounts);

- relay long distance calls expences to your company instead of your own;
